# API Module

## Overview

The API module provides endpoints for external system integration with the PrintAI Dashboard. This module handles alert notifications from monitoring systems and external status updates for printers.

## Features

- Alert handling from monitoring systems
- Printer status updates via API
- Integration points for third-party systems

## Views

- `handle_alert`: Processes alerts from monitoring systems
- `printer_status_update`: Updates printer status information

## URLs

- `/api/alert/`: Endpoint for receiving alerts
- `/api/printer/<printer_id>/status/`: Endpoint for printer status updates

## Integration

This module serves as an integration layer for external systems to interact with the PrintAI Dashboard. It provides JSON-based API endpoints that can be called by monitoring systems, automation tools, or custom scripts.

## Usage

The API module is used for automated system integrations and does not have a user interface component. It works with the Printers module to update printer status and with notification services to handle alerts.

## Security

All endpoints implement appropriate authentication and authorization to ensure secure access. API endpoints validate request data and implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
